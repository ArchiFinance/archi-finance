# What is Archi Finance?

Archi Finance is a GLP leveraged yield farming protocol. It has two sides to it: passive liquidity providers who earns low risk interests by supplying single-asset liquidity; and degen farmers who borrow those assets in a delta neutral way to farm with 10x leverage on GLP.
